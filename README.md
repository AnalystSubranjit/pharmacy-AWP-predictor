# pharmacy-AWP-predictor
Used the pharmaceutical data sponsored by RxRefund to determine the most effective AWP price for a product.

Worked with:
    Raymond Chu
    Lauren Pagano
    
We parsed the data for elements that we determined not to be outliers 
and trained a regression model to predict AWP based on acquisition costs.
